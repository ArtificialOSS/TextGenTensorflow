Nvidia Unveils H100 NVL Inference Platform Optimized for Large Language Model Deployments

Nvidia unveiled this week four new inference platforms optimized for generative AI applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. The new platforms include Nvidia's latest GPU innovations and inference software to deliver optimal performance for AI-based workloads such as large language model (LLM) deployment, image creation, and AI-powered video.  "The rise of generative AI is requiring more powerful inference computing platforms," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. "The number of applications for generative AI is infinite, limited only by human imagination. Arming developers with the most powerful and flexible inference computing platform will accelerate the creation of new services that will improve our lives in ways not yet imaginable." For those unfamiliar with it, AI inferencing is what happens after a neural network has been trained using existing data. The next step is to confront this trained neural network to real-world data and see if it can successfully apply what it previously learned to this new data. 
Just like deep neural network training, AI inferencing requires a lot of GPU power. However, Nvidia has a new H100 NVL platform that's optimized for generative AI inference workloads. NVIDIA's H100 NVL inference platform is optimized for Large Language Model Deployments. The Nvidia H100 NVL is one of the four new inference platforms that Nividia announced earlier this week. "The new H100 NVL with 94GB of memory with Transformer Engine acceleration delivers up to 12x faster inference performance at GPT-3 compared to the prior generation A100 at data center scale," Nvidia said. If Nvidia's H100 NVL platform won't be available until the second half of 2023, the chip maker said that it's "ideal for deploying massive LLMs like ChatGPT at scale." Cohere, a Canadian startup working on natural language processing models is one of the companies that's already testing Nvidia's new inference platform ahead of its general availability. "NVIDIA's new high-performance H100 inference platform can enable us to provide better and more efficient services to our customers with our state-of-the-art generative models, powering a variety of NLP applications such as conversational AI, multilingual enterprise search and information extraction," said Aidan Gomez, CEO at Cohere. The three other inference platforms Nvidia announced this week include the Nvidia L4 GPU for AI video, which is already available in private preview on the Google Cloud Platform. Lastly, the Nvidia L40 GPU for image generation is already available from leading manufacturers, while the Nvidia Grace Hopper superchip for recommendation models will start shipping in the second half of 2023. 


Bidens' tax returns show first couple made $579,514 in 2022 President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden earned $579,514 in 2022, slightly lower than their previous year's earnings, according to new tax returns released Tuesday by the White House. The release comes on the deadline for Americans to file their taxes with the Internal Revenue Service. The White House also released tax returns showing Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff made $456,918 last year, a significant decline in their income from 2021, when they sold a residence. The president and first lady paid $169,820 in combined federal, Delaware, and Virginia income taxes last year. Of that, they owed $137,658 to the federal government, which resulted in an effective federal income tax rate of 23.8%. Their joint income mostly consisted of the president's $400,000 annual salary, set by Congress, along with pensions. The first couple brought in a little more than $5,000 from two S Corporations – CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. – which the White House has said previously were set up to receive royalties from their writing and speaking engagements. The income from those corporations was down significantly from a year prior, when they brought in almost $62,000. The first lady earned $82,335 from her teaching position at Northern Virginia Community College. The Bidens donated $20,180 to 20 different charities in 2022, including $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation. The charity, named after the president's late son, is aimed at protecting children from abuse. Other organizations that the couple gave to include the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a group that offers support to grieving military families, as well as St. Joseph on the Brandywine, a Catholic church that the Bidens attend in Wilmington, Delaware. The 2022 returns are mostly in line with the taxes filed one year prior, when the Bidens earned $610,702 and paid $150,439 in federal income taxes at a rate of 24.6%. Harris and Emhoff owed $93,570 in federal income taxes with an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5%. Harris and Emhoff contributed $23,000 to charity last year, including $5,000 each to Howard University and the University of Southern California, the vice president's and second gentleman's respective alma maters. The White House restored the practice of releasing the president's and vice president's tax returns in a show of transparency after it was eschewed by the Trump administration. "Once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has released the most tax returns of any president while in office," the White House said, noting Biden has now shared 25 years of tax returns. After years of secrecy, six years of former President Donald Trump's taxes, including those from his time in the White House, were later released to the public through the House Ways and Means Committee. They showed the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.

Georgia DA seeks to disqualify attorney for 'fake electors' in Trump investigation ATLANTA - An Atlanta-area district attorney investigating whether former president Donald Trump and his allies broke the law when they sought to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia asked a judge to disqualify an attorney representing some of the Republican "fake electors" who signed certificates falsely stating Trump had won the election in Georgia, claiming the attorney did not tell her clients they had been offered immunity deals in the case. In a court motion filed Tuesday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) asked for attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow, who represents 10 of the alternate Republican electors, to be removed from "any further participation" in the case. Prosecutors claim Debrow committed an ethical breach by representing so many clients simultaneously - including electors who have "made adverse claims" against other electors that Debrow represents, which prosecutors say is clear conflict of interest. The filing cites interviews Fulton County prosecutors conducted on April 12 and April 14 with some of the electors represented by Debrow, which Debrow attended. "During these interviews, some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts," the filing states. "Additionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022." Prosecutors say those claims are in "direct conflict" with statements made in court last year by attorney Holly Pierson, who previously served as Debrow's co-counsel in the case. Pierson told a judge they had informed their clients about offers of immunity made by Willis's office as prosecutors sought their testimony before a special purpose grand jury impaneled to investigate alleged 2020 election interference. In an email, Debrow denied the allegations, calling the prosecution motion "baseless, false, and offensive." "None of my clients have committed any crimes," Debrow said, adding that they "have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes." "Each interview referred to was recorded, and the court will be able to hear for itself how the DA's office has completely misrepresented the facts," Debrow added. "I have ethically and professionally represented my clients at all times, and I will continue to do so." Pierson - who now represents just one of the electors, Georgia Republican Party Chair David Shafer - said the prosecution allegations are "entirely false" and that the court "already has documents in its possession … that prove the DA's allegations false." "Sadly, the DA's office continues to seem more interested in media attention, trampling on the constitutional rights of innocent citizens, and recklessly defaming its perceived opponents than in the facts, the law, or the truth," Pierson said in an email. The motion comes as Willis has signaled she is close to making public her decision on whether she will file charges in the high-stakes investigation, which has ensnared not only Trump and some of his closest aides and allies but a litany of prominent Republicans including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and several top Georgia officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who were targets of Trump's lobbying to overturn Joe Biden's narrow victory in the state. Willis, a longtime Fulton County prosecutor who was elected district attorney in 2020, launched her investigation into alleged election interference just days after a recording was made public of a January 2021 phone call that Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to "find" enough votes to overturn Trump's defeat in Georgia. It was one of several calls Trump and his associates made to Georgia officials prodding them to undertake efforts to change the results of the state's presidential election, which Trump lost by fewer than 12,000 votes. But Willis has indicated publicly and in court filings that her office's investigation has expanded include several other lines of inquiry, including false claims of election fraud that Giuliani and other Trump associates made to Georgia state lawmakers; threats and harassment targeting Georgia election workers; and the alternate Republican electors. Willis and her team are said to be closely examining not only Trump's phone calls but what knowledge he had and role he played in efforts including those false electors. Willis has indicated she is eyeing Georgia's expansive anti-racketeering law as she considers whether Trump and his allies conspired to break the law in seeking to overturn the state's election results. Willis told The Washington Post last year that she and other prosecutors had heard credible allegations that serious crimes had been committed and that she believed some people could be facing prison sentences. At least 18 people have been notified they are targets of the election interference investigation, according to court documents and statements from their attorneys. That list includes Giuliani and the slate of 16 alternate Republican electors. Last year, Willis sought the testimony of those electors before the special grand jury, but only one is known to have been among the 75 witnesses who appeared before the panel. Last year, prosecutors waged a battle to block Pierson and Debrow from jointly representing 11 of those GOP electors, describing it as a violation of legal and ethical rules. In November, Judge Robert McBurney, who presided over the special grand jury, ruled that Shafer could not share an attorney with the other 10 electors represented by Pierson and Debrow. At that time, Pierson took Shafer's case, while Debrow represented the other group. The legal fees for Shafer and the 10 electors are being paid by the Georgia Republican Party. Willis's filing Tuesday indicates that some of those electors who had been reluctant to give testimony in the case may now be cooperating with the investigation - though it was not immediately clear if that was because they had been granted immunity or if any had provided information beyond interviews with prosecutors. A spokesman for Willis declined to comment. The special grand jury was dissolved in January after issuing a final report on its findings. That report remains mostly sealed to protect the rights of "potential future defendants," according to McBurney. But Emily Kohrs, the panel's forewoman, has said the grand jury recommended the indictment of several people. She has declined to say whether Trump was among them - citing McBurney's instruction to keep jury deliberations private until prosecutors decide whether to file charges - but also told reporters the public would not be "shocked" at the panel's recommendations given news about the case. Last month, Trump's Georgia-based legal team - Drew Findling, Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg - seized on Kohrs's public comments about the grand jury proceedings as they filed a motion to quash the panel's report and block prosecutors from using any evidence gathered during the investigation. They argued the panel was "unconstitutional" and had violated Trump's due process rights. Trump's lawyers also sought to remove Willis and her office from the case along with McBurney - suggesting he had given poor advice to the grand jury. McBurney, who continues to oversee the case, has ordered prosecutors to file a response to Trump's legal team by May 1. Willis has said little publicly about her timeline for potentially bringing a case. In January, Willis told McBurney during a court hearing that charging decisions were "imminent," but she later clarified to a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she did not necessarily mean she would announce those decisions anytime soon. Tuesday's filing indicates that Willis's investigation continues to be active, and a source close to the case has said prosecutors are continuing to review evidence as Willis nears her public announcement on potential indictments. To bring charges, Willis would have to present her case to a regular grand jury that, unlike the special-purpose grand jury, has the power to bring criminal indictments. In Fulton County, grand jury terms begin every two months. The next panels are scheduled to begin the first week of May.

Nestled comfortably inside the extreme-right echo chamber created by Fox News and its fellow media travelers, the Republican Party is unable to detect the electoral storm gathering over the 2024 election. Most state and national GOP leaders have failed to comprehend that the fear and outrage tactics they have employed in recent years have fallen out of favor with a large slice of the electorate. A majority of voters have rediscovered the value of using the government to address real problems, as opposed to being distracted by the fabricated issues dredged up each year by right-wing candidates and media to drive a frightened and/or angry GOP base to the polls. A number of the factors that produced a historic win for Democratic candidates in the 2022 elections will result in another historic loss for Republican candidates in 2024. Democrats will win the presidency, take back the majority in the House, and may even retain control of the Senate. The Senate is tricky for Democrats next year because they must win at least 22 races to retain their majority in that body, but losing just one or two seats will still be a victory. Democrats will also make significant gains in statehouses across the country, except in the reddest of states. The factors that will drive those results are abortion extremism, a demand for gun safety, Trump-inspired internecine warfare in the GOP and massive voter turnout. Republican politicians may realize that a number of these factors are boding ill for them as the election approaches, but they are not in a position to do much about it. When the Trump-appointed Supreme Court majority struck down Roe v. Wade right before the 2022 election, a few commentators predicted the historic win for Democrats. Now, rather than recognizing the serious threat posed to them by an extremist position on abortion, most Republicans have doubled down on the issue. Red states, as well as some purple states, are passing all sorts of abortion restrictions. Trump-appointed, politically-driven judges are trying to limit the use of a medication that can prevent or terminate an unwanted pregnancy. The Supreme Court should, and probably will, dismiss the trumped-up case on technical legal grounds - Justice Samuel Alito temporarily froze the court's order late Friday - but it will serve as a continuing reminder of the MAGA world's desire to limit the reproductive freedom of women. As women die from lack of proper maternal care and doctors desert states with severe abortion restrictions, this issue will be a bigger millstone around Republican necks than it was in 2022. Another issue that is finally gathering steam as the election approaches is gun safety. By election time next year, it will be a potent issue against Republicans who believe the rights of gun owners trump the right of families to have safe streets and schools. Our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are fearful of sending them. Republicans act as if it is an either-or situation, which it isn't. We can allow people to exercise reasonable, responsible gun rights while protecting the public from war weapons and irresponsible gun practices. If we can regulate the rights of people who drive on our streets, why should we not regulate the use of deadly firearms? This issue will catch many Republicans by surprise at the polls in 2024. It is clear that Donald Trump will present a major challenge for Republicans in the 2024 election. In spite of the numerous legal problems he will be plagued with in the coming months, his near-fanatic base will not desert him. He can't win the general election, but he can, and quite probably will, keep any other Republican candidate from having a reasonable chance of doing so. The destructive dance between Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is instructive. DeSantis needs to differentiate himself from Trump without alienating the Trump base. It can't happen because Trump won't permit it. Every other GOP candidate faces the same problem. Some of Trump's followers may wish that he would withdraw, but if he stays in the running he is likely to be the 2024 GOP candidate. That will ensure a win for Biden or any other Democrat who may end up in the running. Trump will again interfere in down-ticket races, supporting candidates who pledge fealty to his MAGA ideas. Republican candidates will be reluctant to stray from the anti-abortion, anti-democracy, pro-gun orthodoxy imposed by Trump and his media admirers. Rather than dealing with the many real problems facing the country and its constituent parts, we will be deluged with fake culture war issues, like critical race theory and LGBTQ issues, that are losing their luster with serious voters. He lost gettable congressional seats for the GOP last year and will do so again next year. These issues will produce a massive 2024 turnout of voters, intent on punishing the Grand Old Party for democratic backsliding, infringing on the rights of women and minorities, disregarding the rights of families to be safe in public places and pandering for votes on fabricated issues instead of attending to the hard work of resolving real problems facing Americans at every level of government. The Republican Party may see a wave coming but has painted itself in a MAGA corner from which it can't escape in time. It will be swamped by a wave of suburbanites, women and young people who have had enough and won't take it anymore.

Seeking revenge against his former lawyer for airing all his dirty laundry, indicted former President Donald Trump on Wednesday sued his one-time fixer, Michael Cohen for more than $500 million. The 32-page lawsuit, filed in South Florida federal court, aims to punish Cohen for violating a confidentiality agreement by divulging secrets about their attorney-client relationship when he wrote memoirs full of salacious details-and subsequently became the star witness for the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal case against the ex-president. Cohen has told the world all about the way Trump allegedly used him to quietly pay off porn star Stormy Daniels to cover up an extramarital affair, claims that led a New York County jury to criminally indict Trump last month for faking business records. The lawsuit claims that Cohen should have abided by the attorney-client rules and nondisclosure agreement, even though Cohen has been disbarred and several of Trump's infamous ironclad hush deals are now being scrutinized by judges as improper.Fox News media host Howard Kurtz couldn't bring himself to repeat the hefty $787.5 million settlement his employer paid to Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday, claiming he was unable to "independently confirm" the amount. Kurtz, whom Fox forbade from covering the Dominion lawsuit before easing that restriction last month, made several on-air appearances to discuss the shocking settlement on Tuesday. Kurtz's first report on Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto's broadcast took place just before Dominion's lawyers announced the bombshell dollar figure in a press conference. However, during his appearance on Special Report two hours later, the MediaBuzz host merely stated: "A Dominion lawyer gave reporters a dollar figure for the settlement, but I have not been able to independently confirm that." Additionally, Kurtz made a point to note that "there is undoubtedly disappointment on other networks that would be relishing this spectacle" of Fox News executives and stars taking the witness stand. Even though Kurtz couldn't tell the right-wing network's viewers how much Fox had to shell out for its 2020 election lies, at least Cavuto ended his broadcast by quickly reporting the figure.Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) on Tuesday took a shot at the "fringy fringies" who came up with the baseless conspiracy theory that he was replaced with a body double to explain why he looked slightly different in photographs taken before and after he suffered a stroke last May. In a vertical video posted to his Twitter, Fetterman calls the theory "just crazy," before the video cuts to "another" Fetterman walking through the front door. "Yo, dude, John, what event am I supposed to be doing this afternoon?" the supposed copy of Fetterman asks. The senator replies: "Dude. Really?" Both Fettermans-the Fettermen, perhaps-then shrug at the camera. The video was posted a day after the Pennsylvania lawmaker made his return to the Senate following a two-month absence to receive treatment for depression.Scouted selects products independently.

Keith Nale, a memorable contestant who took part in two seasons of Survivor, has died after battling cancer. He was 62. "He passed away this afternoon," Nale's son, Wes, told ET on Tuesday. "He'd been battling cancer for the past few months and we found out about it in January." Nale's brother Kevin added: "It [happened] so quickly. Cancer ate him up. He passed this afternoon at his home in Shreveport, Louisiana." Nale made it to the final of Survivor: San Juan del Sur and was eliminated just two days before the Final Tribal Council on Survivor: Cambodia. His fellow contestant on the later show, Kelley Wentworth, called Nale "a man with the purest heart, who brought humor into moments where it was needed most." "I'm grateful I had the opportunity to meet Keith & share memories together on the beaches of Nicaragua & Cambodia," she tweeted. "My heart is with the entire Nale family. This is a devastating loss." The northern New York man charged with murder in the killing of a young woman who was in a car that mistakenly pulled into his driveway on Saturday night is unrepentant about the incident, the Washington County Sheriff told CNN on Tuesday. Kevin Monahan, "quite frankly, has not shown any remorse in this case," Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said. Monahan, 65, was taken into custody hours after he allegedly shot Kaylin Gillis, with Murphy saying that he "refused to exit his residence to speak with police." His lawyer, Kurt Mauser, contested the sheriff's description of events, denying to CNN that there had been any kind of standoff. Mauser also said that his client felt that "there was menace going on" when the car-part of a group searching for a friend's address that included one other vehicle and a motorcycle-came up his driveway. The sheriff countered by saying the group was "clearly leaving the residence when the shots were fired," according to witness accounts and forensic evidence.Scouted selects products independently.

Move over overpriced group fitness classes (and my cursed habit of putzing around the gym without any idea which machine to attempt to use), because Obé Fitness is bringing accessibility and variety to the fitness industry. This online fitness program offers over 10,000 live and on-demand workouts, ranging from every type of class you've ever considered taking and every type of class you wish you could keep taking but can't justify selling a bicep and quadricep for every month. Right now, Obé is offering annual plans for only $99 (new members only), which is literally half the price of some monthly membership plans I've looked into. And honestly, this isn't even the best thing about Obé Fitness–I'd argue the best thing is how flexible their classes are, with lengths ranging from five to 60 minutes and categories from yoga to HIIT to barre and cycling. It's literally giving Santa's reindeer, but make it fitness. Plus, you can take their live classes pretty much any time you'd take any other in-person fitness class-from the comfort of your own home. All in all, if you're looking for something to awaken your love for movement, you should move your attention onto Obé's site and check out all the ways that you can incorporate more movement into your daily routine without spending a fortune or committing to a gym. Thousands of students at Staley High School in Kansas City walked out Tuesday to offer support to their classmate, Ralph Yarl, after he was shot by an 84-year-old homeowner while approaching the man's door by mistake. Yarl, 16, who is Black, was attempting to pick up his siblings from a friend's house when he walked up the steps to Andrew Lester's front porch by accident. Lester, who is white, has since been charged with first-degree assault. The walkout was meant to "support Ralph in his recovery and have a positive impact on the community," a spokesperson for the school district told local news outlets. "We stand with you, we support you and know that we're going to be here for you," a senior named Cayla, who helped organize the unity walk, told KSHB-TV.

A group of non-native feral horses on Cumberland Island, an island off Georgia's southeast coast, have been named as plaintiffs in a case against the federal government and the National Park Service. The lawsuit alleges the habitat surrounding the animals on Cumberland Island's National Seashore has been gradually damaged by the equines and that they should therefore be moved off the land. In a filing last week, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Park Service officials are named as the defendants in the case, which was brought by the Georgia Equine Rescue League Ltd., the Georgia Horse Council Inc., Center for Biological Diversity Southeast Director Will Harlan, Cumberland Island resident Carol Ruckdeschel. Interestingly, even the horses of Cumberland Island are named. "The horses have standing to bring a suit in their own right," the lawsuit claims, using an example of a former court ruling–Loggerhead Turtle v. Volusia County Council–that recognized wildlife as plaintiffs. "NPS and the State have inadequately managed and failed to remove the Island's feral horses by knowingly ignoring the laws, policies, rules, and regulations put in place to protect the Cumberland Island National Seashore and its resources. Defendants' failure to fulfill their collective obligations has inflicted serious harm to Cumberland's horses, requiring their removal from the Island, and has permitted the horses, in the natural course of their existence, to inflict serious harm to the Island's natural and wilderness resources." The current number of horses on the island is estimated at between 140-170. A judge in Florida who denied a teenager an abortion over her poor grades in school-and then later lost a re-election over the issue-is back, this time jockeying to be the next justice on the Florida Supreme Court. The Tampa Bay Times reported that Jared Smith is one of several wannabe justices on a shortlist drawn up by the Florida Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission, which said Tuesday it would interview Smith and 14 other candidates in early May. The commission will then make recommendations to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a noted fan of Smith's who lifted him out of humiliating electoral defeat last year by appointing him to the 6th District Court of Appeals. The state's highest court is expected to hear arguments in a lawsuit over an abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, one of the state legislature's most controversial measures passed after the fall of Roe v. Wade. A fundraising group specifically set up to aid House Republicans in danger of losing re-election in New York has turned its back on Washington's favorite scandal-plagued fabulist, with Politico reporting Tuesday that the group has no plans to come to Rep. George Santos' rescue. Paperwork filed by Protect the House New York 2024, which boasts House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as a member, notably excluded Santos from a list of candidates for whom it plans to raise funds. The omission comes a day after Santos announced plans to run for re-election. Asked whether he would support Santos in his fresh bid on Monday, McCarthy "let out a laugh," according to a CNN reporter. Without backing from his party, Santos' chances look slim, with it being reported over the weekend that his campaign is already scrambling for cash. A report filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission indicated that Santos refunded more money than he took in in contributions, receiving only $5,333 while returning $8,353 to contributors in the first three months of the year.

TensorFlow today released TensorFlow 2.12.0! Check out the GitHub repo to learn more about the update. In the updated version, the tensorflow-gpu and tf-nightly-gpu packages have been effectively removed and replaced with packages that direct users to switch to tensorflow or tf-nightly. The name was the only difference between the two sets of packages ever since TensorFlow 2.1, so there is no loss of functionality or GPU support. Furthermore, the ‘tf.function’ now uses the Python inspect library directly for parsing the signature of the Python function. This factor can break certain previously ignored functions where signature is malformed including the use of ‘functools.wraps’ on a function with different signature and using ‘functools.partial’ with an invalid tf.function input. The updated function also enforces input parameter names to be valid Python identifiers and incompatible names are automatically sanitized similar to the existing SavedModel signature behavior. The function now has an experimental.Fingerprint that contains the fingerprint of the SavedModel. It also has an API for reading the fingerprint of a SavedModel. The new version also includes TraceType which now requires an additional placeholder_value method to be defined. Instead of the value itself, ‘tf.function’ now traces with TraceTyle generated placeholder values. Major improvements have been made to Keras as well. All saving related tasks have moved to keras.saving, a new namespace. The previous API locations (in keras.utils and keras.models) are still available but it’s recommended to update the code to point to the new API locations. The previous Keras version may have ignored the mark but now the users will get an error if they pass a mask with an incompatible shape. For TensorFlow Lite, float LSTM will now support diagonal recurrent tensors and the users can add 16-bit float type support for built-in op fill. Also, transpose now supports 6D tensors. 

The Relevance of NLP Engineers in a ChatGPT-Crazy World In the current times of LLMs-gone-wild, NLP engineers are in the thick of things and will presumably be one of the first ones to see the repercussions of this shift. When a disruption on the scale of ChatGPT comes along, there’s a sea change made to every job it touches. Older job titles in tech become redundant as quickly as new ones are formed. In the current times of LLMs-gone-wild, NLP engineers are in the thick of things and will presumably be one of the first ones to see the repercussions of this shift. Up until now, the job description of an NLP engineer was a lengthy list of requirements, including expertise in text representation, semantic extraction techniques, data structures and modelling. LLMs are more accessible with plugins But plugins have found a way to make these LLMs accessible beyond the sludge of just internet training data. Among a host of other tasks like scheduling tasks and doing taxes, plugins are able to help with language translation and sentiment analysis. Plugins can turn a mere chatbot or an LLM into an ecosystem overnight. If ChatGPT is a smartphone, the plugins are the apps on the phone. And the OpenAI Application Programming Interfaces or APIs have figured out a more user-friendly prototype for users, which is not just for those who have learned command sequences. But despite the simplicity of these interfaces, many LLM algorithms need to be customised depending on the industry they are being used in. For example, LLMs used in the healthcare industry have to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs), suggest treatments and summarise patient healthcare reports based on the doctor’s notes and voice recordings. Similarly, LLMs in the financial sector will have to summarise earnings calls, create meeting transcripts and even perform fraud analysis to protect consumers. While it has become simpler to interact with an LLM — all that the chatbot needs is a prompt, this has given birth to an entirely new skill called prompt engineering. Almost as soon as the job title itself came about, an offer posted by Anthropic AI for a ‘Prompt Engineer and Librarian’ within a salary range of USD 175,000 to USD 335,000 turned heads. A new future for NLP engineers? In a blog posted in December last year, Miguel Ballesteros, principal applied scientist with Amazon Web Services’ AI Labs discussed how NLP is tilting towards prompt engineering. “In the past, we used to have feature engineering, where you have a statistical model, and you are adding different types of representations or features, and then you need to tune the model along with your features. These days, with large language models, the new thing that is coming is the idea of prompts, in all of its variations, as a way of priming the models,” he stated. All this while, feature engineering has been the backbone of NLP processes with very specific techniques for different types of problems. For example, some problems might require us to extract grammatical features from the text, while some might just need us to get the frequently occurring words. On the face of it, prompt engineering may seem like it’s a skill that’s easily learned but experts have called this a falsehood. “Suppose we are interacting with ChatGPT and ask it to, “Write about your day.”. This prompt is vague and doesn’t provide any specific direction or context. It’s unclear what the writer should focus on or what kind of response is expected. This is an example of a bad prompt, especially in an enterprise context. Now, if we are to ask “Describe a memorable moment from your day, including what happened, how it made you feel, and why it was significant to you.” This prompt is specific and provides clear direction, outlining what the writer should include in their response. It’s also open-ended enough to allow for creativity and personalization in the writer’s answer,” Parag R., senior manager of data science at Accenture discussed in his blog posted in March. Prompt engineering DOES need skills The heat that prompt engineering jobs are gathering also doesn’t immediately make the skills of NLP engineers redundant. After all, even if LLMs are easy to talk to, they aren’t telepathic. “If you tell a chatbot to create a complex piece of software, it will shrug its shoulders. But tell it to break down the tasks needed to do so into chunks and then start working on those chunks one by one, and you are more likely to start getting somewhere. So it’s unlikely that all those years you’ve spent learning about coding and software engineering have gone to waste. You’ll still need that knowledge and experience to help you pick the right prompts and to ensure that ChatGPT’s output is on the right track,” author and tech strategist Bernard Marr noted in a Forbes article. Startup advisor and tech strategist Ashish Mukherjee explains, “There can be parallels drawn between this and the past. At one point the roles of system administrators were thought to have become defunct but eventually as the environment became more complex, they evolved into becoming DevOps engineers. And all their past experiences did come to count. As a technological advancement happens, the market responds to it adequately. That’s exactly what I predict will happen with NLP engineers. As things get commodified and the complex use cases increase, they arm themselves with new skills like prompt engineering. Human judgement is still important.” Prompts are a tricky thing. The right sequence of words can give us exactly what we need from the chatbot while the wrong prompt can elicit gibberish. And who can understand the science behind language better than an NLP engineer?

Alibaba's breakup lifts hopes China's regulatory winter is thawing Investors cheered a major revamp of Alibaba Group as a sign Beijing's crackdown on the corporate sector was nearing an end, sending shares of the Jack Ma-founded company and its peers soaring on Wednesday. Alibaba said on Tuesday it was planning to split into six units and explore fundraisings or listings for most of them, in the biggest restructuring of the technology conglomerate in its 24-year history. Investors cheered a major revamp of Alibaba Group as a sign Beijing 's crackdown on the corporate sector was nearing an end, sending shares of the Jack Ma-founded company and its peers soaring on Wednesday. Alibaba said on Tuesday it was planning to split into six units and explore fundraisings or listings for most of them, in the biggest restructuring of the technology conglomerate in its 24-year history. The group's Hong Kong -listed shares jumped as much as 16.3%, tracking a 14.3% rally in its U.S.-listed shares overnight , leading the benchmark Hang Seng Index and broader markets in the region higher. The move represented a light at the end of the tunnel for many investors who had seen a wave of regulatory blitzes as a major cloud hanging over China 's private sector. "We think this is likely a sign that we are moving closer to the end of the regulatory scrutiny on BABA and we would expect that the company moves back into the good graces of the regulators and policy makers after this," said Jon Withaar , head of Asia special situations at Pictet Asset Management. Alibaba said it will hold a conference call on Thursday to discuss its plan to split. Its group CEO and chairman Daniel Zhang may join the call, according to people familiar with the matter. China 's wide regulatory crackdown over the last couple of years on its marquee domestic companies, mainly from the internet, private education and property sectors, had wiped off billions in market values and weighed on investor sentiment. Alibaba said on Tuesday it would split into six units - Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, Local Services Group , Cainiao Smart Logistics Group, Global Digital Commerce Group and Digital Media and Entertainment Group . The group had been planning to spin off individual business units for a long time, according to another two sources familiar with the company's thinking. "There was a consensus within and outside Alibaba that the stock was trading at a major discount to the inherent value of the businesses," said one of the people, adding that the company had become "too bloated". The person said there would be five initial public offerings from the units, while Taobao and Tmall , Alibaba 's core revenue drivers, would remain with the current listed entity. Hong Kong is the most likely venue for these IPOs, said the person, and a separate source familiar with Chinese tech companies' capital markets transactions. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In Japan , SoftBank Group Corp, which has a 13.7% stake in Alibaba , shot up 6.2%. SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment. Alibaba itself would re-organise into a holding company structure, with Zhang retaining his position as group CEO, and the six sub-divisions each with their own CEOs and boards. Zhang will also head the cloud-focused unit. It would not be the first time Alibaba has spun off its business units. In 2011, the company hived off its fast-growing payments arm Alipay , which later evolved into the fintech major Ant Group . PAIN ENDING? Analysts at Bank of America on Tuesday described Alibaba 's restructuring as "an important experiment", which would test whether or not China 's biggest companies could meet Beijing 's demand to "contribute to society". Alibaba was a common target during the crackdown period. It faced scrutiny for engaging in monopolistic behavior in the e-commerce space, as well as its data security practices in its cloud business and labour practices for its delivery units. In what many observers viewed as symbolic of the regulatory chill, Ma, its founder, left China in late 2021 and was seen travelling to a number of different countries. He was spotted on Monday in Hangzhou , home to Alibaba , just one day before the company announced the restructuring. Zhang Zhihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset Management, said that on top of Ma's return and the restructuring, new leadership and local governments have recently softened their stance towards China 's private sector, giving investors confidence. Shares in JD.com Inc, Alibaba 's longtime e-commerce rival, jumped as much as 7.8% on Wednesday. Tencent Holdings Ltd, China 's largest gaming company, saw shares rise as much as 5.1%. Alibaba 's split may pave the way for other Chinese tech giants to undergo similar restructuring, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said. "This helps break down the monopolistic power of these conglomerates, which complies with the Chinese government's regulatory overhaul over antitrust issues," she said. In addition to its core gaming and social media businesses, Tencent also has cloud and fintech arms. JD.com has in recent years made a number of spin-offs, including its JD Logistics and its cloud and AI focused arm JD Digits . Brian Tycangco , who tracks China 's tech sector at Stansberry Research , said that in addition to enabling higher valuations, the restructuring better protects individual divisions from future government regulation. "Any new regulations will likely not affect the whole company now - just the particular division that that regulation covers," Tycangco told Reuters.
